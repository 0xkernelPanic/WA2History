Context leading to the event

Before the 19th century, the applications of rubber were quite limited, due to rubber's sensitivity to temperature changes, which altered its shape and consistency. However, improvements to a process called vulcanization, which modified rubber so that it would support extreme temperatures caused rubber to become suitable for producing hoses, tires, industrial bands, sheets, shoes, shoe soles, and other products. Along with the rise in popularity of the motor car and the bicycle at that time, the demand for rubber dramatically increased in the late 19th century and early 20th century leading to the rapid expansion of the rubber industry.
